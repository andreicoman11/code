<img align=right src=open-source.jpg><h2>Problem A: Open Source</h2>
At an open-source fair held at a major university, leaders of
open-source projects put sign-up sheets on the wall, with the
project name at the top in capital letters for identification. 
<p>
Students then signed up for projects using their userids.  A userid is
a string of lower-case letters and numbers starting with a letter.
<p>
The organizer then took all the sheets off the wall and typed in the
information.
<p>
Your job is to summarize the number of students who have signed up for
each project. Some students were overly enthusiastic and put their
name down several times for the same project. That's okay, but they
should only count once. Students were asked to commit to a single
project, so any student who has signed up for more than one project
should not count for any project.
<p>
There are at most 10,000 students at the university, and at most 100
projects were advertised.
<p>
Input Specification:
<p>
The input contains several test cases, each one ending with a line
that starts with the digit 1. The last test case is followed by a line
starting with the digit 0.
<p>
Each test case consists of one or more project sheets. A project sheet
consists of a line containing the project name in capital letters,
followed by the userids of students, one per line.
<p>
Output Specification:
<p>
For each test case, output a summary of each project sheet. The
summary is one line with the name of the project followed by the
number of students who signed up. These lines should be printed in
decreasing order of number of signups. If two or more projects have
the same number of signups, they should be listed in alphabetical order.
