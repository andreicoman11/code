<img align=right src=smeech.jpg><h2>Problem B: Smeech</h2>

Professor Octastichs has invented a new programming language, Smeech.

An expression in Smeech may be a positive or negative integer, or
may be of the form
<tt>
   (<i>p</i> <i>e<sub>1</sub></i> <i>e<sub>2</sub></i>)
</tt>
where <i>p</i> is a real number between 0 and 1 (inclusive) and
<i>e<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>e<sub>2</sub></i> are Smeech expressions.
The value represented by a Smeech expression is as follows:
<ul>
<li>An integer represents itself
<li>With probability <i>p</i>, <tt>(<i>p</i> <i>e<sub>1</sub></i> <i>e<sub>2</sub></i>)</tt> represents
<i>x+y</i> where <i>x</i> is the value of <i>e<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>y</i> is the value of <i>e<sub>2</sub></i>;
otherwise it represents <i>x-y</i>.
</ul>
Given a Smeech expression, what is its expected value?
<p>
Input consists of several Smeech expressions, one per line, followed by a
line containing ().  For each expression, output its expected value to
two decimal places.
