<HTML><BODY><H2>Problem A: Unique Snowflakes</H2>
    <IMG align="right" src="./A_files/A.jpg">

Emily the entrepreneur has a cool business idea: packaging and selling
snowflakes. She has devised a machine that captures snowflakes as they
fall, and serializes them into a stream of snowflakes that flow, one by
one, into a package. Once the package is full, it is closed and
shipped to be sold.
<P>
The marketing motto for the company is &quot;bags of uniqueness.&quot;
To live up to the motto, every snowflake in a package
must be different from the others. Unfortunately, this is
easier said than done, because in reality, many of the snowflakes
flowing through the machine are identical. Emily would like to
know the size of the largest possible package of unique snowflakes
that can be created. The machine can start filling the package
at any time, but once it starts, all snowflakes flowing from
the machine must go into the package until the package is completed
and sealed.
</P><H3>Input Specification</H3>
The first line of input contains one integer specifying the number of
test cases to follow. Each test case begins with a line containing
an integer <I>n</I>, the number of snowflakes processed by the machine.
The following <I>n</I> lines each contain an integer (in the range
0 to 10^9, inclusive) uniquely identifying
a snowflake. Two snowflakes are identified by the same integer if
and only if they are identical.
The input will contain no more than one million total snowflakes.
