<img align=right src=laser.jpg><h2>Problem A:  War on Weather</h2>
After an unprovoked hurricane attack on the south shore,
Glorious Warrior has declared war on weather.  The first
salvo in this campaign will be a coordinated pre-emptive
attack on as many tropical depressions as possible.  GW
reckons that the attack will neutralize the tropical
depressions before they become storms, and dissuade 
others from forming.
<p>
GW has at his disposal <i>k</i> space-to-earth killer
satellites at various locations in space.  <i>m</i> 
tropical depressions are known to exist at various
locations on the earth's surface.  Each satellite
can attack any number of targets on the earth provided there
is <i>line of sight</i> between the satellite and
each target.  How many different targets can be hit?
<p>
The input consists of several test cases.  Each case
begins with a line containing integers
<i>0 &lt; k, m &le 100</i> as defined above.  <i>k</i>
lines follow, each giving <i>x,y,z</i> - the location in space
of a satellite at the scheduled time of attack.  <i>m</i> lines then follow, 
each giving
<i>x,y,z</i> - the location of a target tropical depression.
Assume the earth is a sphere centred at (0,0,0) with
circumference 40,000 km.  All targets will be on
the surface of the earth (within 10<sup>-9</sup> km) and all
satellites will be at least 50 km above the surface.
A line containing 0 0 follows the last test case.
<p>
For each test case, output a line giving the total
number of targets that can be hit.  If a particular
target falls within 10<sup>-8</sup> km of the boundary
between being within line-of-sight and not, it may
be counted either way.  (That is, you need not consider 
rounding error so long as it does not exceed 10<sup>-8</sup> km.)
