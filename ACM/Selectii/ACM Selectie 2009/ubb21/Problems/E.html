<img align=right src=pre.gif><h2>Problem E:  Prerequisites?</h2>
Freddie the frosh has chosen to take <i>k</i> courses.
To meet the degree requirements, he must take
courses from each of several categories.  Can you assure
Freddie that he will graduate, based on his course selection?
<p>
Input consists of several test cases.  For each case,
the first line of input contains <i>1 &le; k &le; 100</i>,
the number of courses Freddie has chosen, and <i>0 &le; m &le; 100</i>,
the number of categories.  One or more lines follow containing <i>k</i> 4-digit integers follow; each is the number
of a course selected by Freddie.  Each category is represented by
a line containing <i>1 &le; c &le; 100</i>, the number of courses in the
category, <i>0 &le; r &le; c</i>, the minimum number of courses
from the category that must be taken, and the <i>c</i> course numbers in the category.
Each course number is a 4-digit integer.  The same course may fulfil
several category requirements.  Freddie's selections, and the
course numbers in any particular category, are distinct.  A line
containing 0 follows the last test case.
<p>
For each test case, output a line containing "yes" if Freddie's
course selection meets the degree requirements; otherwise output "no."
