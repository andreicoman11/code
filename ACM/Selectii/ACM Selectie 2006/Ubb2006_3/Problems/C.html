<img src="C_files/period.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">

Given is a function <em>f: 0..N --&gt; 0..N</em> for a non-negative
<em>N</em> and a non-negative integer <em>n</em> &#8804; <em>N</em>.  One
can construct an infinite sequence <em>F = f<sup>&nbsp;1</sup>(n),
f<sup>&nbsp;2</sup>(n), ... f<sup>&nbsp;k</sup>(n) ... </em>, where
<em>f<sup>&nbsp;k</sup>(n)</em> is defined recursively as follows:
<em>f<sup>&nbsp;1</sup>(n) = f(n)</em> and <em>f<sup>&nbsp;k+1</sup>(n)</em> =
<em>f(f<sup>&nbsp;k</sup>(n))</em>.
<p>
It is easy to see that each such sequence <em>F</em> is eventually
periodic, that is periodic from some point onwards, e.g 1, 2, 7, 5, 4,
6, 5, 4, 6, 5, 4, 6 ... .
Given non-negative integer <em>N &#8804; 11000000 </em>, <em>n &#8804; N</em> and
<em>f</em>, you are to compute the period of sequence <em>F</em>.
</p><p>
Each line of input contains <em>N</em>, <em>n</em> and the a
description of <em>f</em> in postfix notation, also known as Reverse
Polish Notation (RPN).  The operands are either unsigned integer
constants or <em>N</em> or the variable <em>x</em>.  Only binary
operands are allowed: + (addition), * (multiplication) and % (modulo, i.e. remainder of integer division).
Operands and operators are separated by whitespace.  The operand %
occurs exactly once in a function and it is the last (rightmost, or
topmost if you wish) operator and its second operand is always <em>N</em>
whose value is read from input. The following function:

</p><pre> 
            2 x * 7 + N % 
</pre> 

is the RPN rendition of the more familiar infix <tt>(2*x+7)%N</tt>.  All input
lines are shorter than 100 characters. The last line of input has
<em>N</em> equal 0 and should not be processed.

<p>
For each line of input, output one line with one integer number, the period
of <em>F</em> corresponding to the data given in the input line.


</p><h3>Sample input</h3>
<pre>10 1 x N %
11 1 x x 1 + * N %
1728 1 x x 1 + * x 2 + * N %
1728 1 x x 1 + x 2 + * * N %
100003 1 x x 123 + * x 12345 + * N %
0 0 0 N %
</pre>
