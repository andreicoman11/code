<img src="H_files/recpaint.jpg" align="right" hspace="20" vspace="20">

A rectangle with sides parallel to the x-y axes and its left-lower corner
at (0,&nbsp;0) is being painted.  The rectangle may be thought of
as a flat-screen display
with almost infinite resolution; initially the entire rectangle is
black.  Two numbers are given 0 &lt; <b>h</b>, <b>v</b> &lt; 1 and then
<ul>
<li> A vertical
line is drawn dividing the horizontal sides of the rectangle in
proportion
<b>h</b>:1-<b>h</b> from the left.  
</li><li> A horizontal line is drawn
dividing the vertical sides of the rectangles in proportion
<b>v</b>:1-<b>v</b> from the bottom up.  
</li><li>These two lines divide the
rectangle into four smaller rectangles.  
</li><li>The upper left and the
lower right sub-rectangles remain intact.  
</li><li>The color
of the other two rectangles is flipped (from black to white or from
white to black) and now each of them is subject to the operation
just performed on the bigger rectangle.  
</li><li> This process continues (in principle) forever.
</li></ul>

Given a point in the original rectangle but not on the boundary of any
rectangle that turns up in the process of painting, determine the color
of the point.
<p>
Input contains multiple cases.  The first line of each case 
contains 4 numbers, the length of the rectangle <b>H</b>, the height of the
rectangle <b>V</b> and then the numbers <b>h</b> and <b>v</b>.  The next
line contains one integer number <b>n</b>, the number of points to consider.
The following <b>n</b> lines contain two numbers each, the <b>x</b> and
the <b>y</b> coordinate of a point.
</p><p>
Organize your output as shown in the sample.  For each point from input
print the color of the point.
