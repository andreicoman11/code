The University of Calgary team qualified for the 28th ACM
International Collegiate Programming Contest World Finals in Prague,
Czech Republic.  Just by using the initials of team members they
got a very cunning team name: <b>ACM</b> (<b>A</b>lecs,
<b>C</b>elly and <b>M</b>onny).  In order to prepare for the
contest, they have decided to travel to Edmonton to learn
the tricks of trade from <b>D</b>ilbert, Alberta-wide famous
top-coder.
<p>
Due to a horrible miscommunication which is as welcome as a plague
among such teams,
<b>A</b>, <b>C</b> and <b>M</b> drive from Calgary to Edmonton in
separate cars.  To make things worse, there was also a
miscommunication with <b>D</b>, who being always so helpful, decides
to go to Calgary in order to save the team a trip to the far, freezing
North.  All this happens on the same day and each car travels at a
constant (but not necessarily the same) speed on the famous Alberta #2.
</p><p>
<b>A</b> passed <b>C</b> and <b>M</b> at time <em>t1</em> and
<em>t2</em>, respectively, and met D at time <em>t3</em>.
<b>D</b> met <b>C</b> and <b>M</b> at times <em>t4</em> and
<em>t5</em>, respectively.  The question is: at what time
time did <b>C</b> pass <b>M</b>?
</p><p>
The input is a sequence of lines, each containing times <em>t1</em>,
<em>t2</em>, <em>t3</em>, <em>t4</em> and <em>t5</em>, separated by
white space. All times are distinct and given in increasing order.
Each time is given in the hh:mm:ss format on the 24-hour clock.
A line containing -1 terminates the input.
</p><p>
For each line of input produce one line of output giving the time when 
<b>C</b> passed <b>M</b> in the same format as input, rounding the
seconds in the standard way.
</p><p>
