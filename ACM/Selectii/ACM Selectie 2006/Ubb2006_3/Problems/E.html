<h2>Problem E: Crabbles</h2>
<img src="E_files/crabbles.jpg" align="right">
<p>
Jennifer is practicing for a Crabbles tournament. She pulls out a
handful of Crabbles tiles out of a bag, and tries to form the word with
the highest possible score. Each tile contains a letter (used to form
the word) and a number (its score value). She can use each tile at most
once in her word, and she is not required to use every tile. The word
that she forms must appear in her dictionary. Her score
is the sum of the values of the tiles used in the word.
</p>
<p>
Note that in Crabbles, different tiles with the same letter
may have different score values.
</p>
<p>
To check her work, Jennifer would like a program to tell her the maximum
score possible for the set of tiles. Your task is to write this program.

<h4>Input Specification</h4>
The first line contains an integer 1 &#8804; N &#8804; 100,000
indicating the number of words in the dictionary. N lines follow,
with one dictionary word on each line. Each dictionary word consists
of only lowercase letters. The following line contains an
integer 1 &#8804; M &#8804; 1000 indicating the number of Crabbles hands
Jennifer wants to play. M hands follow. Each hand begins with
a line containing an integer 1 &#8804; P &#8804; 10 indicating the
number of tiles in the hand. This is followed by P lines, one
for each tile. Each of these lines consists of a lowercase letter
(the letter on the tile), a space, and an integer 0 &#8804; V &#8804; 10
(the value of the tile).

<h4>Output Specification</h4>
For each hand in the input, output a line containing the maximum score
possible with that hand.
