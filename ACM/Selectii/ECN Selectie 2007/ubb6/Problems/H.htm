<p>
Assume you have a square of size <i>n</i> that is divided into <i>n&times;n</i>
positions just as a checkerboard.
Two positions <i>(x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>)</i> and <i>(x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>)</i>,
where <i>1 &#8804; x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>,x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub> &#8804;
n</i>, are called "independent" if they occupy different rows and
different columns, that is, <i>x<sub>1</sub>&#8800;x<sub>2</sub></i> and <i>y<sub>1</sub>&#8800;y<sub>2</sub></i>.
More generally, <i>n</i> positions are called independent if they are
pairwise independent.
It follows that there are <i>n!</i> different ways to choose <i>n</i>
independent positions.
</p>
<p>
Assume further that a number is written in each position of such an <i>n&times;n</i>
square.
This square is called "homogeneous" if the sum of the numbers written in
<i>n</i> independent positions is the same, no matter how the positions
are chosen.
Write a program to determine if a given square is homogeneous!
</p>
<p><b>Input Specification</b></p>
<p>
The input contains several test cases.
<br>
The first line of each test case contains an integer <i>n</i> (<i>1 &#8804;
n &#8804; 1000</i>).
Each of the next <i>n</i> lines contains <i>n</i> numbers, separated
by exactly one space character.
Each number is an integer from the interval <i>[-1000000,1000000]</i>.
<br>
The last test case is followed by a zero.
</p>
<h4>Output Specification</h4>
<p>
For each test case output whether the specified square is homogeneous or
not.
Adhere to the format shown in the sample output.
