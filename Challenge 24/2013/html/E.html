<h2>E. Stack compressor</h2>
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td align="justify">

In its wide range of different products, a flagship model carefully designed
and manufactured by IGG is a clever processor. The unit implements a
huge flash-based program memory, a large SRAM-based stack, a great
32-bit ALU and rich I/O facilities, all integrated
on the same chip. Even though the product itself is one of the best on the market,
due to a somewhat unfortunate and ill-planned marketing campaign, sales have lagged.
There is still a large quantity left from the first production batch.
<p>
The sales department now suggests that demand could be raised by demonstrating the
extraordinary capabilities of the device in specific application
domains, such as text compression.

<p>
Your task is to show how well the architecture is suited for text compression
by providing example programs that output a much larger amount of meaningful data
than the original size of the program.
<p>
Write program that outputs exactly the input file of the task - the smaller the
code is, the better.
All instructions increases program size by 1 except that PUSH counts as 2.
<p>
Numbers are 32-bit signed numbers (-2<sup>31</sup> &le; n < 2<sup>31</sup>).
Overflows cause error.
It is an error if there are not enough elements on the stack for an instruction.
The stack is empty at startup. Limits:
<UL>
	<LI> max stack size: 20 million elements
	<LI> max step count: 300 million instructions executed
</UL>

<H3> Instruction set </H3>
Stack description notation:
<UL>
	<LI> "..." means original content of the stack
	<LI> "a|b" means <i>b</i> on top of <i>a</i> (the last is the topmost element on the stack)
	<LI> "s[N]" the Nth element of the stack
</UL>

<tr> <th> instruction <th> description <th width=15%> stack before <th width=15%> stack after

<tr> <th> PUSH&nbsp;const <td> Push a constant to the top of the stack.
     <td> ... <td> ...|const

<tr> <th> OUT  <td> Pop the top element of the stack and write it to
    the output as an ASCII character. It is an error if <i>a</i> &gt; 127 or <i>a</i> &lt; 0.

<tr> <th> READ  <td> Pop the top element of the stack, <i>a</i>,
    and push a copy of the <i>a</i>-th element of the stack on top.
    For <i>a</i> &ge; 0, the stack is indexed from the bottom.
    For <i>a</i> &lt; 0, the stack is indexed from the top.
    (for example the element below <i>a</i> can be indexed with -1).

    (<i>a</i> = -1 jumps back to the current JGZ instruction).
    Execution stops if JGZ jumps out of the code in either direction.

<h3>Input</h3>

Plain text 7-bit ASCII, written in English. Expect some control characters
(e.g. form feed).

<h3>Output</h3>

The program in plain text: a list of instructions, each in a separate line,
case-sensitive.

<h3>Scoring</h3>

Scores for this problem are scaled against fixed constants (not the solutions of other teams),
otherwise it works like normal scaled problems:
multiple solutions can be submitted but only the last one counts.
<p>

The real score of a size S program is
<pre>
SCORE = 20 + 80*(A - S)/(A - B)
</pre>
where A, B parameters are given in the table below.
SCORE is rounded to the nearest integer and then truncated to [0,100].
