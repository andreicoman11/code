<h2>C. Road roller</h2>

One of the factors slowing down operations at the IGG steel mill is
the uneven concrete surface of the factory yard where incoming raw
material is received and sorted. Fortunately
there's still time to use one of the brand new products of the company, the <i>EZRoller</i>
to get a flat surface. <i>EZRoller</i> looks like a traditional road roller but
has a number of advanced features:

<UL>
	<LI> no need to roll forth and back over the same spot: a single roll
	results in a completely flat surface, at the level specified by the user
	(<i>EZRoller</i> is heavy)
	<LI> cutting edge 3000 BHP power plant (<i>EZRoller</i> is fast)
	<LI> there is a button to start, stop, and turn (<i>EZRoller</i> is very user friendly)
</UL>

</table>
<p>
Unfortunately these features impose a limitation on the path <i>EZRoller</i> can
follow: it is not possible to turn without stopping, and the turn button
allows turning only in 45 degree steps. Due to inertia, stopping and starting are very
time consuming operations, so the operator of <i>EZRoller</i> is asked to avoid
these whenever possible (it's much easier to rely on <i>EZRoller's</i> extreme
strength and sturdiness, and "think outside the box", so to speak).
<p>
You need to find a short path for <i>EZRoller</i> for leveling all the points
specified on the surface of the factory yard.

<h3>Input</h3>
Lines of X Y pairs for each point that needs to be levelled (X and Y are integers).

<h3>Output</h3>
The task is to define a line of connected segments by their
endpoints such that it covers all the points given in the input
and the number of segments is minimal.
<p>
The segments can be vertical, horizontal or 45 degree
diagonals. The endpoints of the segments should be
given as X Y pairs in order, one per line (X and Y must be integers).

<h3>Score</h3>
This is a scaled problem and the real score is
<pre>
SCORE := round(100 * (1 - sqrt(1 - Kmin/K)))
</pre>
where K is the number of segments in the output and Kmin is the best submission so far.

<h3>Example input</h3>
<pre>
1 5
2 2
3 4
4 1
4 4
5 1
5 3
5 5
</pre>

<h3>Example output</h3>
<pre>
4 1
3 1
3 5
1 5
1 1
5 5
5 1
</pre>
So (4, 1) is connected to (3, 1), (3, 1) is connected to
(3, 5) and so on. This gives a path of 6 segments.
