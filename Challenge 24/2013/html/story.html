<h2> Prologue: Recovering From Recession </h2>

International Geek Gadgets, Ltd (IGG) is heavily affected
by the current economic recession. The CEO, your old friend,
is struggling to find a way out. She already identified the
seven major areas in the company where optimizing current processes
could result in a noticeable increase of efficiency. She has also realized such
optimization would require the help of computer programs.
<p>
Instead of hiring an expensive analyst, she thought you'd help her
on the basis of friendship - and she offered you the 35 years old PDP-11
gathering dust in her basement to sweeten the deal, if everything goes well.
<p>
Beside optimizing business processes, she also opted for advanced
quality assurance qualification - auditors are scheduled to arrive in five hours and will
have unlimited power to screen any activity in the company. After
the auditors put their stamp on the papers, it will be impossible
to change any process further.
<p>
You enlisted the help of two of your even geekier friends to have a chance
at meeting the deadline. You have only five hours to solve as many of the
seven deficiencies as possible.
