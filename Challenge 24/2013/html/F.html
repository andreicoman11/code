<h2>F. Backup communication</h2>
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td align="justify">

At each site, IGG has many buildings, with modern means of communication
connecting them. Unfortunately these communication lines all depend on electricity.
In case of a blackout, transmitting management orders becomes
impossible using those channels. Off the shelf backup communication systems
are extremely expensive, and the CEO has realized IGG is already
manufacturing all the important components of an alternative solution: cannons,
gunpowder, titanium capsules, paper and pen. The idea is to place a single
cannon near the HQ and fire orders in the direction of each building.
In case of emergency, the typical usage is to send the same message to all
buildings with the smallest amount of effort.

<p>
Your task is to determine the optimal placement of the cannon (on each of the
10 sites of the company) to minimize the energy required to broadcast orders.
<p>
The energy required for a single shot is quadratic in the
launch velocity <i>v</i> of the capsule, ie.
<pre>
  E = const * v * v
</pre>
<p>
The elevation and direction of the cannon barrel can be
easily set as well as <i>v</i>.
The broadcast cost is the sum of the energies of all
shots with optimal cannon settings.
<p>
Careful measurements show that the aerodynamic drag can
be discarded and the maximum range of the cannon is
larger than the distance between any two buildings.

<h3>Input</h3>

First line contains N the number of targets, the next N lines
contain X,Y coordinates of the target buildings in km.

<h3>Output</h3>

The X,Y coordinates of the cannon, it must be within 0.1 m of the optimal placement.
