A secret agency got its hands on old classified records.
They ask you to rescue the data from the disks.
<p>
These are 120rpm disks with few seconds of audio
and are supposed to hold a sequence of decimal digits.
<p>
The track begins at the outer edge of the disks and
the needle of the gramophone follows it towards
inside.
