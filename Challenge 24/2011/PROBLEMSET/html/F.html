<h2>F. Allocator</h2>

<tr><td align="justify">
 Pear, manufacturer of the now popular jDesk portable music player, faces
 a problem: the cheap SRAM they purchased is all faulty, right before
 the great demo where the company is to present the new model to the 
 potential customers. As a quick
 workaround, they want a special memory allocator to be designed, that allows
 the few common memory usage patterns to work on the device, so that at least those
 few programs they want to show on the demo would happen to work.
<p>
 There are three types of RAM problems, each affecting random bits of
 the memory:
<ul>
<li> bit stuck in 1 state
<li> bit stuck in 0 state
<li> bit is unreliable (returns random number for each read, unusable)
</ul>
<td> &nbsp;&nbsp; <td>
<img src="eprom.jpg">
</table>
<p>
 To isolate the problem, Pear mapped the memory use of those few common memory usage
 patterns they want to sell their devices with. These maps contain only
 the following instructions:
<table align=left>
<tr><td> a n              <td> allocate <I>n</I> bytes of memory
<tr><td> f IDX            <td> free the memory allocated by the <I>IDXth</I> 'a' instruction
<tr><td> w IDX ofs sz str <td> write string from byte offset <I>ofs</I> of the allocation; number of bytes is <I>sz</I>
<tr><td> r IDX ofs sz     <td> read <I>sz</I> long string from byte offset <I>ofs</I> of allocation <I>IDX</I>
</table>
<p>
 String is given as a space-separated list of decimal numbers between 0 and 255;
 <I>ofs</I> and <I>sz</I> are always decimal numbers in bytes, &gt;= 0. <I>sz</I>
 is always smaller than 1024.
<p>
 Note: <I>IDX</I> is the reference of the allocation, the index of the "a" command
 in the dump; first instruction of the dump has <I>IDX</I>=0.
<p>
 Programs written for Pear products are perfect - they never write/read
 beyond the allocation, and never read uninitizalized parts of the memory,
 never allocate &lt;= 0 bytes, never allocate more than the amount of host memory
 at a given time, never do illegal free operations.
 They also always free all memory used by the end of the program execution.

<p>
 The memory fault map is given as a sequence of the following structure,
 each in a new line:
<pre>
  address mask0 mask1 maskF
</pre>
<p>
 where address is a decimal address in the memory (byte offset), mask0 is
 the bitmask of bits stuck 0, mask1 is the bitmask of bits stuck 1,
 maskF is the bitmask of faulty (unusable bits).

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> size of the memory (in bytes), number of memory faults, number of dump entries
<li> memory fault map
<li> memory operation dump
</ul>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
A linear list of allocation addresses in the order of allocation,
0 &lt;= address &lt; size of memory

<h3>Example input</h3>
<pre>
26 2 7
21 5 8 18
25 1 2 12
a 6
a 10
w 0 2 3 112 177 221
w 1 0 4 112 6 6 6
r 0 2 2
r 1 0 3
f 0
f 1
</pre>
<p>
Notes: first instruction is an allocation.

<h3>Example output</h3>
<pre>
2
10
</pre>
