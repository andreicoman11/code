<h2>E. Labeling</h2>
<table width="100%" border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td align="justify">
The task is to place city name labels on various zoom levels of a world map.

<img src="map.png" alt="world map">
<p>
A list of cities with name, location and population is given in a tab separated
file, <code>cities.txt</code>, the description of the columns is in the
<code>cities.readme</code> file.
<p>
The label is written on the map using a 6x10 unit fixed width font, so it
covers a rectangular area which height is 10 units and width is 6 units times
the number of characters in the name of the city.
<p>
A label should be placed right next to its city and labels must not overlap.
<p>
The coordinates of a geographic location on the map is given by
<pre>
x = longitude * SCALE
y = latitude * SCALE
</pre>
<p>
where longitude and latitude are in degrees as in <code>cities.txt</code>
and x, y are in the same units as the font of the labels.
<p>
The map wraps around horizontally so a label truncated on the right continues on
the left side of the map. Vertically labels must not get truncated.
<p>
People are happy when they see the label of their city displayed on the map
and you want to make as many people happy as possible.

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
Single line containing the <code>SCALE</code> number.

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
Each line of the output must contain three numbers separated by whitespace:
<code>ID,X,Y</code>.
Where <code>ID</code> is the id of a city (first column in <code>cities.txt</code>),
and <code>X,Y</code> are the coordinates of the
center of the label of the city (in map coordinate system).
<p>
Labels may appear in arbitrary order in the output and you don't have
to label every city.
<p>
The location of a city must be on the boundary of its label and labels
must not overlap, these constraints will be checked with 0.1 unit precision.
<p>
The map is cylindrical and the coordinate system wraps around horizontally:
<code>X+360*SCALE,Y</code> is the same point as <code>X,Y</code>.
When printing the coordinates of a label make sure that
<pre>
-180 * SCALE &lt;= X &lt;= 180 * SCALE
-90 * SCALE + 5 &lt;= Y &lt;= 90 * SCALE - 5
</pre>

<h3>Score</h3>
<pre>
P = sum(population of labelled cities)
SCORE = 100 * (1 - sqrt(1 - P/MAXP))
</pre>
where <code>MAXP</code> is the best <code>P</code> submitted so far.
<p>
Note that a rendered map with the best labeling will be published at
<a href="http://ch24.org/ec/labeling">http://ch24.org/ec/labeling</a> during the
contest.

<h3>cities.txt</h3>
<p>Example lines from <code>cities.txt</code>
<pre>
...
37051	HU	Budakeszi	47.51667	18.93333	13248
37052	HU	Budaors	47.46181	18.95845	25089

<h3>Example input</h3>
<pre>
2.0
</pre>

<h3>Example output</h3>
<pre>

</pre>
<p>
In this case the city is at the top left corner of the label.
