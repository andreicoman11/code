<h2>D. Uniq</h2>
<p>
Given N strings, count the number of different strings.
<p>
The strings will be generated by a pseudo random number generator,
so you don't have to worry about downloading and parsing large text
files.
<p>
A string is represented by a sequence of integers. The first integer
is the number of characters in the string, each one of the following
integers encode a character of the string. Such integer sequences can
be concatenated to represent multiple strings.
<p>
The integer sequence representing the given N strings is generated
by the following linear congruential generator:
<pre>
X := SEED
A := 8433437992146984169
B := 7905438737954111703

function nextinteger():
	X := (A*X + B) mod (2^64)
	return X / (2^56)
</pre>
where ^, / and mod are exponentiation, integer division
and modulo operations with the usual semantics.

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>
A single line containing two integers: N and SEED.

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>
The number of different strings.

<h3>Example input</h3>
<pre>
4 11413960417
</pre>

<h3>Example output</h3>
<pre>
3
</pre>
<p>
Random numbers are 2, 245, 71, 1, 46, 4, 105, 177, 135, 114, 1, 46, 154, 195, ...
<br>
The lengths of the four strings are 2, 1, 4, 1.
